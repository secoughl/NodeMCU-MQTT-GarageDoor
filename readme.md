# NodeMCU-MQTT-GarageDoor
### Are you tired of 
- Garage doors that a stoopid?!
- Smart garage doors that cost too much money and come with sUbScRiPtIoN fEeS?!
- IFTTT being an absolute trash product created by trash people in some trash part of the trash world?
- Having exactly two too many transistors for your transistor drawer to close easily?!

### Then look no further!

Built on an ESPwhatever, uses MQTT messages to decide what door to open/close and when. In my case integrates with Google and Amazon voice assistants using HACloud because otherwise that shit looked **hard**.

Example script/sensor info included.

Update secrets_example.h with your pertinent info and then rename it secrets.h. Or not. Do whatever. I'm not your real dad anyway.
